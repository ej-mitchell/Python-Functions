# Python-Functions
Just a bunch of functions made for random tutorials.
(1) Is it prime?;
(2) Reverse that string;
(3) Gettin' Factorial with it (a story in recursion);
(4) Let's Play: Battleship (simple);
(5) The next square root (gets the square root of the next perfect square);
(6) Dimsum: Summing Digits in a Number;
(7) Money Money Money (my solution from the Code Wars kata)
